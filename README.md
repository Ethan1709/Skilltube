The Portfolio Project is the culmination of our rigorous foundational year at Holberton School, where we showcase our proficiency as developers.
Our team has developped a streaming website, "Skilltube" demonstrating our skills to create complex software solutions.

# Why Skilltube ?
During all the year in Holberton, the most important thing we learn is to find the good ressources at the good moment. This is not easy and not fast and requires extra skills. We decided to help other students everyone looking for a good video.
